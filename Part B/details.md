# Question No. 5
You are writing a program to keep track of how many times the user has entered a number. Assume the user can only enter one-digit numbers (a.k.a 0-9). The user can input numbers as  many times as they want, however, if they enter anything that is not a number between 0-9, they will not be allowed to input any more numbers. 

After the user can no longer input numbers, your program should display the output in the following format: 

**Number**   **Number of Occurrences**
    0                   2
    1                   10

# Question No. 7
The following program attempts to print a message containing an integer representing a day of
the week (where 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 7 = Sunday) and then print the corresponding day
name. For example: You entered Wednesday. In its current state, the program contains logical
errors. Locate the problems and repair them so the program will work as expected. Rewrite the
corrected code using switch cases as well.
